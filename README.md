# subhttp

Simple bash script to run Sublist3r, add http and https to all subdomains and save to a .txt file. 

Great for then piping results into something like EyeWitness or doing manual testing of domains after running Sublist3r.

*NOTE: This script requires you to have Sublist3r installed.
